        <p class="words">Among Karate practitioners there are conflicting thoughts as to the suitability of the first strike in a defensive orientated martial art. Some may suggest that it goes against the character or ethos of Karate. Within Kyokushin Karate, however, the first strike is well embedded in the basic syllabus and is taught from the beginning, as it is seen as an important part of karate's self defence package.</p>
